# CS-330-Computational-Graphics-and-Visualization
This repository contains the final project for CS-330: Computational Graphics and Visualization, showcasing a 3D scene created using OpenGL.

## Project Overview
This project involved designing and developing a 3D scene with multiple objects, textures, and lighting. The scene was built using basic geometric shapes, transformed and arranged to resemble real-world objects. Key aspects of the project include:

*   **3D Modeling:** Constructing low-polygon representations of objects using basic shapes like boxes, cylinders, and cones.
*   **Texturing:** Applying realistic textures to the 3D models to enhance visual appeal.
*   **Lighting:** Implementing lighting with ambient, diffuse, and specular components to create a polished look.
*   **Camera Control:** Allowing user navigation through the scene using keyboard and mouse inputs.
*   **Perspective and Orthographic Views:** Enabling switching between different projection modes for viewing the scene.

## Design Decisions
The design of the 3D scene was guided by the goal of creating a realistic representation of a photography-themed setting. This involved selecting appropriate objects, such as a camera, lenses, tripod, and film boxes, and arranging them in a natural way. The use of textures and lighting further enhanced the realism of the scene.

The camera control system was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing for easy navigation through the scene. The ability to switch between perspective and orthographic views provides flexibility in how the user visualizes the 3D scene.

## Development Strategies
The development process involved an iterative approach, starting with basic shapes and gradually adding complexity in terms of object details, textures, and lighting. This allowed for continuous testing and refinement of the scene.

Key development strategies included:

*   **Modularity:** Using custom functions to encapsulate specific tasks, such as loading textures and setting shader parameters, for better code organization and reusability.
*   **Transformations:** Utilizing transformation matrices to position, scale, and rotate objects within the scene.
*   **Lighting:** Implementing the Phong shading model to achieve realistic lighting effects.
*   **Camera Management:** Implementing a camera class to handle user input and update the view matrix accordingly.

### Design

*   **Approach:** My approach to software design starts with understanding the core requirements and then breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable components. This project reinforced the importance of planning and sketching out the scene before diving into the cod
*   **New Skills:** Working on this project helped me improve my spatial reasoning skills and understand how to translate real-world objects into 3D representations. I also gained a better grasp of using textures and lighting to create realistic scenes.
*   **Design Process:** I followed an iterative design process, starting with a basic layout and gradually refining it based on visual feedback and experimentation. This involved constant tweaking of object positions, sizes, and material properties.
*   **Future Applications:** The iterative design approach and the focus on modularity are valuable lessons that I can apply in future projects. Additionally, the experience in creating 3D representations will be beneficial in any work involving visualization or simulation.

### Development

*   **Approach:** My approach to program development is to start with a clear understanding of the algorithms and data structures involved. I then focus on writing clean, well-commented code that is easy to read and maintain.
*   **New Strategies:** In this project, I learned new strategies for working with 3D graphics, such as using transformation matrices and implementing lighting models. I also gained experience in using OpenGL and GLSL.
*   **Iteration:** Iteration was central to my development process. I started with basic shapes and gradually added complexity, testing and refining the scene at each step. This allowed me to identify and fix issues early on.
*   **Evolution of Approach:** Throughout the milestones, my approach to developing code became more structured and organized. I learned to break down the problem into smaller functions and to use comments effectively to explain my code.

### Computer Science and My Goals

*   **Computational Graphics and My Future:** Computational graphics and visualizations provide me with valuable skills that are applicable in various fields, including game development, animation, and data visualization. This knowledge will be useful in my future educational pursuits, especially if I choose to specialize in areas related to computer graphics or human-computer interaction.
*   **Professional Applications:** In my future professional pathway, computational graphics and visualizations can open doors to opportunities in industries that rely on visual representations, such as architecture, engineering, and entertainment. The ability to create realistic and interactive 3D scenes is a valuable asset in today's job market.
